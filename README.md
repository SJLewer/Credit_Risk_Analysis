# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
Employee different techniques to train and evaluate models against with unbalanced classes to predict credit risk.

Techniques used:
1. Oversample
    - RandomOverSampler
    - SMOTE
2. Undersample
    - ClusterCentroids
3. Combined approach
    - SMOTEENN
4. Compare machine learning models that reduce bias
    - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
    - EasyEnsembleClassifier

## Results:
_Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
 
 
## Summary/Recommendation:
_Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
